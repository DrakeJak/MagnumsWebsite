# MagnumsWebsite
Website design for Magnums Bar and Eatery

Some factors in the website design
  •	The magnums logo is a golden colour, so I believe that the navigation bar should include a golden element (maybe the text)
  •	Instead of having a background colour, I think an appealing design for a bar/ restaurant website would be to have the background pictures consist of element of the establishment. This could be things like the outdoor patio, food, drinks, etc.
  •	The footer I am thinking of implementing will either have the contact information or hours of operation or both.
  •	The 404 link will be in the footer (clicking on the link in the footer will take you to the 404.html page)

Post design reflection

Upon the completion of my website, there has been some reworking from my original design. 
The way I originally designed my navigation bar felt to simple for how I wanted it to look, 
and after reviewing other bar/restaurant websites I decided that having a separate ‘about’ 
page would be better than having it all on the landing page ‘home.html’. And as for the footer, 
I decided that having only the contact information would suffice as the landing and contact 
pages both have the hours of Magnums Bar & Eatery. If I were to exclude having the contact 
information on every page it would hinder the users experience and possibly cause frustration
that could lead to less calls for takeout orders.

Another thing to mention is the video that is currently in the about page is not for 
Magnums Bar & Eatery, but I wanted to having a place holder to show what I would expect 
to put there in the future if I were to continue with the project. Obviously, I am not a 
videographer so I would be hiring someone to make a very similar video showing off some 
of the foods and service that for Magnums Bar & Eatery provides.
